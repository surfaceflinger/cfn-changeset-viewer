# cfn-changeset-viewer

This CLI will view the changes calculated in a CloudFormation ChangeSet in a more human-friendly way, including rendering details from a nested change set.

## Usage

```txt
cfn-changeset-viewer <changeset-id>
Usage:
  <changeset-id> the id of the changeset to view
```

## Display

A table will be printed to stdout, scaling to fit the width of your terminal. From left to right are the following:

- An icon showing what kind of change has been made (Add: `+`, Modify: `~`, Remove: `-`, Import: `â†“`, Dynamic: `?`)
- Whether or not the resource will be replaced (True: `!`, Conditional: `?`, False: empty)
- Type of the resource being changed
- LogicalId of the event's resource (for nested stacks, this will be rendered as `NestedStack/NestedResource`)
- The property being modified
- The source of that modification (`!Ref/!GetAtt`, direct modification, or [automatic change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ResourceChangeDetail.html))
